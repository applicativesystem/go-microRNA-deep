# go-microRNAs-deep

- a microRNA go package for implementing the deep learning approaches.
- takes the predicted microRNAs, fasta and extracts the fasta, upstream, downstrea, tokenization and neural network. 
- prepares the microRNA predictions from 6 predictions tools into a single package and gives you the structured data with tokenization for direct input as weights into the neural networks. 
- I implemented this package in both GO and RUST for a special issue in Springer Invitation.
