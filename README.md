# go-microRNAs-deep

- a microRNA serialization for implementing the deep learning approaches.
- takes the predicted microRNAs, fasta 
- prepares the site extraction, tokenization using json serialization. 
- it supports all the target prediction algorithms for deep learning. 
- I implemented this package in both GO and RUST for a special issue in Springer Invitation.
